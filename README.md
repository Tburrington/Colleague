# Colleague
 

Summary: 
    An app to track after-hours gaming competitions or ongoing rivalries at companies.

Getting Started:
    You'll need to establish your own databse through ElephantSQL or some other resource, and then you can add games through the game input page. The project is tied in with expo, so to spin up the application, we suggest using expo. The node server will also need to be started through npm start. 

Currently:
    Colleague is an ongoing project, and seeks to serve interoffice communities.
